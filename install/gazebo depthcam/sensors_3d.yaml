  # Parameters specific to the Depth Map updater are:

  #  image_topic: This specifies the topic to listen on for a depth image.

  #  queue_size: The number of images to queue up.

  #  near_clipping_plane_distance: The minimum distance before lack of visibility.

  #  far_clipping_plane_distance: The maximum distance before lack of visibility.

  #  shadow_threshold: The minimum brightness of the shadow map below an entity for its dynamic shadow to be visible

  #  padding_offset: The size of the padding (in cm).

  #  padding_scale: The scale of the padding.
  #
  #  filtered_cloud_topic: The topic on which the filtered cloud will be published (mainly for debugging). The filtering cloud is the resultant cloud
  #  after self-filtering has been performed.
